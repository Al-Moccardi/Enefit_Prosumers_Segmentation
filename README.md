Features
The platform includes several key features:

Current Weather Display: This feature fetches and displays the current weather conditions in Tallinn, Estonia, providing users with up-to-date information on temperature, wind speed, and wind direction.

Data Extraction and Processing: The platform extracts data from a specified ZIP file, processes it, and generates features necessary for further analysis. This ensures that all data is clean and ready for use in the various analytical functions provided.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Users can generate detailed profiling reports for various datasets, allowing for a deep dive into the data to understand its structure, quality, and key characteristics.

Consumer Segmentation: This functionality clusters consumers into meaningful segments. These segments can be used for targeted marketing and personalized customer service, enabling businesses to cater to the specific needs and behaviors of different customer groups.

Prosumer Segmentation: Similar to consumer segmentation, this feature clusters prosumers (consumers who also produce energy). Understanding these segments helps in optimizing energy production patterns and improving overall efficiency.

Power Grid Management: This feature provides tools for analyzing the power grid by visualizing data from both consumers and prosumers. It aids in efficient power grid management by offering insights into energy consumption and production patterns.

Installation and Usage
To start using the platform, you first need to clone the repository from GitHub. Once you have the repository on your local machine, you will install the necessary dependencies. After setting up your environment, you can run the application using Streamlit, a powerful app framework for data science projects.

The main page of the application provides several functionalities:

It displays the current weather in Tallinn, Estonia.
It allows you to load and process data, which includes extracting and preparing the data for analysis.
It provides an option to generate a detailed inspection report of the datasets.
It also has a placeholder for future functionality to add new data.
